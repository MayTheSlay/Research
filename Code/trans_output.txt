Biological Overview: Biological medicines, also called biologics, are those classes of medicines that are grown and then purified in a controlled cell culture process called cell culture in which large amounts of bacteria or yeast, or plant or animal cells are produced. Biologics are a diverse group of medicines that include vaccines, growth factors, immune modulators, monoclonal antibodies, and products derived from human blood and plasma. What distinguishes biologics from other drugs is that these are usually purified proteins from live cell culture systems in a controlled environment or in blood, whereas other drugs are considered small molecules and are synthetically or purified from plants. Because of the differences in their composition and synthesis, biological therapies are authorized, tested, and regulated differently from other medicines. To ensure quality, safety, and efficacy, each batch of biological therapy product should be thoroughly tested at each stage of production to ensure compatibility with previous batches. The use of WHO global reference standards helps to further ensure product consistency across multiple batches and allows for biological comparisons between producers and/or countries. Establishment of common requirements applicable to different types of product batches governing starting materials, manufacture and control oversight is an important aspect of this process. Although some biological guidelines may be developed to help. Effect: The beneficial biological effects are as varied as the types of products themselves: Vaccines are one of the most powerful and inexpensive means of reducing the burden of disease worldwide and are estimated to save 2 to 3 million lives annually. Other diseases, such as smallpox and two types of smallpox, have been eradicated as a result of worldwide efforts to vaccinate and control their spread. However, as many infectious diseases continue to claim millions of lives each year, the development of new vaccines and other biological products, and new ways to improve their quality, potency, safety, and efficacy, remains a major challenge for public health. Blood products are life-saving products widely used during surgery, for injured patients, or for those with bleeding disorders, and for people undergoing chemotherapy in the treatment of cancer. Most donated blood is divided into its component parts so that one unit can be used to help more patients in need. This collection of agents also includes the body's own cells as well as other methods of gene therapy. There are several alternatives to biological therapy, such as insulin used in the treatment of diabetes, interferons for bacterial infections and cancer treatment, monoclonal antibodies also used in the treatment of certain cancers or autoimmune diseases. Taken together, these products are a great achievement of mankind and commendable examples of biological power in medicine. WHO's response WHO is working with Member States, Collaborating Centres, partners and experts through its biological measurement system to develop and revise guidance for biotherapeutic products and establish international reference standards. Produced guidelines are promoted through their publication on the WHO website, as well as through workshops and training sessions to facilitate their implementation. This achievement has been instrumental in promoting WHO recommendations that encourage the harmonization of international guidelines for biological medicine. Similarly, the development and promotion of WHO's international reference standards helps to ensure that biological therapies are accepted among various manufacturers, countries, and laboratories. It is widely used in assessing the quality and efficacy of biological products, as well as in the calibration of diagnostic tests. Several key initiatives demonstrate WHO's value to biological medicines as potent agents for reducing the global burden of disease. These include the Global Vaccine Action Plan (GVAP) and the Blood Regulators Network (BRN), which consists of leading international authorities on blood, blood products, and in vitro diagnostic devices. WHO also celebrates World Immunization Week every April, with related events aimed at promoting the use and understanding of vaccines and combating vaccine hesitancy worldwide.
