It also supports complex medical and surgical procedures, including anesthesia; inadequate or unsafe blood for transfusion has a negative impact on the effectiveness of health services and programs that are key to patient care in many emergencies and chronic conditions. Efficiency and quality assurance require the delivery of effective blood products. Impact: Blood products contribute to saving millions of lives every year. They improve the chances of remarkable memory retention and quality of life for patients suffering from life-threatening conditions, and support complex medical and surgical procedures. In high-income countries, blood products are widely used to support advanced medical and surgical procedures, including treatments for cancer and hematologic diseases. the relief of traumatic memories. They include cardiovascular surgery and transplantation, and in low-income countries where diagnostic and treatment options are limited, much of the blood supply is used to treat women suffering from severe anaemia during childbirth and buildings suffering from anaemia due to malaria and malnutrition caused by iron deficiency.

To provide strategic direction for global efforts to address existing barriers to the safety and accessibility of blood products in order to expand access to effective and quality blood products: working with Member States and partners to ensure their universal safety through the 6 strategic objectives of the World Health Organization. It aims to provide access to effective and quality-assured blood products. Its objectives are focused on: Properly structured. An integrated and sustainable source of wealth for national blood systems; administrative control. Relevant national frameworks of national standards and quality assessment programs; functional and efficiently managed blood services in all countries; effective monitoring of patient blood management to facilitate a circulatory healthcare system; and effective monitoring. Blood donation safety monitoring system and safe testing system. Supported by comprehensive and accurate data collection systems, achieving major milestones globally. To be a partner in jointly addressing challenges and emerging threats at the continental and national levels. collaboration and information sharing.
